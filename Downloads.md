Download Python [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). 

Though the differences between Python 3.x and 2.x don't make too much of a difference for our uses, we recommend Python 2.x as that is what most other club members are using.

## Git

So what is an IDE anyway?
* Here's [our](IDE.md) TLDR on what to type on.
* Here's [Wikipedia's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment).
