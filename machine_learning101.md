# Machine Learning 101 (for computational-linguistics)

## Introduction

The goal of this brief overview is to familiarize the audience (the computational linguistics club) with some of the ideas of machine learning and the aspects of natural language processing which are innately useful.

A quick word on terminology:

The terms **data mining**, **machine learning**, **artificial intelligent**, **statistics**, etc... are words that often bandied about, and while they may seem inately complicated, the general ideas and goals behind each field are relatively easily communicated.

Generally speaking, there is a good deal of overlap in each field and 

In 1959, Arthur Samuel offered this to described machine learning as a "Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed."

The question is, what does this mean?

## The Tasks

All machine learning

1. Predictive Tasks
2. Descriptive Tasks


## The Challenges

* Scalability
* High Dimensionality
* Heterogeneous and Complex Data
* Data Ownership and Distribution
* Non-Traditional Analysis

## The Methods

#### Cluster Analysis

#### Association Analysis

#### Predictive Modeling

#### Anomaly Detection
